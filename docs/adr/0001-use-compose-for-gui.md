## Context

As the GUI part of projects is getting more and more complex, we need a better way to manage it.

So, we use Kotlin Compose to build the GUI, we can:

- Use Kotlin to build the GUI
- reUse the code in Android and Desktop
- reUse exists Android UI code

## Decision

Use Kotlin Compose to build the GUI.
